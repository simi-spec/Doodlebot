# DoodleBot

DoodleBot is a small robot that can draw using a pen. It uses servos and a basic control system to move the pen around and create shapes or patterns.

## Plan
- Base platform with 2 servo motors to control X and Y movement
- Holder for a pen or marker
- Arduino or similar microcontroller for control
- Program basic shapes (lines, circles)
- Optional: add pattern generation or simple AI-style drawing

## Goal
To build a creative robot that can make drawings and help me learn more about precision movement and robotics.
